# What i learnt from the project
This project was a great opportunity to practice several important web development concepts:

- Working with external APIs and handling asynchronous code
- Fetching and processing data from APIs
- Implementing a mobile-first responsive design approach
- Creating pixel-perfect layouts that match the design specifications
- Writing clean, semantic HTML and CSS code
  
---
# Challenges Faced
-Fetchhing the APIs was kind of hard for me.
-Displaying the Map was difficult.

# Overcome Challenge
-Making use of resources and watching videos.
